# Quantum Machine Learning Application in Escape Routing Problems - A PS 1 Project

## Introduction

This project presents a novel hybrid quantum machine learning approach to solve the emergency escape routing problem in dynamically changing environments, such as those impacted by natural disasters like earthquakes. Traditional algorithms like Dijkstra and A* perform well in static environments but struggle with real-time changes. The paper suggests a solution that combines classical and quantum neural networks to adaptively find optimal escape routes.
